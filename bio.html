<p class="homepage">
Konstantinos Kallas is an assistant professor of CS at the University of California, Los Angeles. 

He is interested in building systems that enable the development of high-performance applications with robust correctness guarantees, both in theory and in practice. 
  
His research spans several domains, from serverless and microservices to the Unix shell and scripting languages in general, has appeared at several venues including OSDI, NSDI, EuroSys, ATC, POPL, OOPSLA, and VLDB, and has received several awards (Dennis M. Richie SIGOPS 2024 dissertation award, best paper award at USENIX ATC 25, best paper at EuroSys 21, best presentation at HotOS 21, and 2nd place at the 2021 ACM SRC Grand Finals).

His research has led to the development of PaSh, the first optimizing compiler for the shell, which is supported by the Linux Foundation.

  During the unconventional summer of 2020 I did an internship
  in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/">RiSE</a>
  in Microsoft Research where I worked
  with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sburckha/">Sebastian
  Burckhardt</a>. During my internship we worked on a new
  implementation
  of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-versions">Azure
  Durable Functions</a>, a programming model for reliable stateful
  serverless applications. The new implementation,
  called <em>Netherite</em>, guarantees reliable execution of stateful
  applications and achieves an order of magnitude improvements in
  throughput and latency compared to the existing
  implementation. These performance improvements can be attributed to
  a series of optimizations, such as batching and speculation, that
  both reduce the number of storage accesses as well move them out of
  the critical path.

  I spent the summer of 2019 in
  the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/">Automated
  Reasoning Group</a> at Amazon Web Services under the supervision
  of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-schwartz-narbonne-5036b9137/">Daniel
  Schwartz-Narbonne</a>. We used the C Bounded Model Checker
  (<a href="http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/">CBMC</a>) to verify that
  certain critical C libraries
  (<a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common">aws-c-common</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-c">aws-esdk-c</a>)
  are memory safe and satisfy important functional correctness
  properties. In the process, I implemented several small extensions
  for CBMC, mostly focused on improving the support for function
  contracts.

  Before my PhD, I was an undergraduate student at
  the <a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/">National Technical University
  of Athens</a>, department
  of <a href="https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en">Electrical and Computer
  Engineering</a>. I completed my thesis “HiPErJiT: A Profile-Driven
  Just-in-Time Compiler for Erlang based on HiPE” under the
  supervision of <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/">Kostis
  Sagonas</a>. It is available online in
  both <a href="/files/theses-reports/thesis.pdf">English</a>
  and <a href="/files/theses-reports/thesis_gr.pdf">Greek</a>.

  In May of 2018 I participated in
  the <a href="http://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT18/">Eighth Summer School on
  Formal Techniques</a> that took place in Atherton, California and
  was organized by <a href="https://www.sri.com/">SRI
  International</a>.

  Throughout my undergraduate studies I have developed software for
  many projects with my colleagues. Some notable examples are a
  complete compiler for the language Edsger
  (<a href="https://github.com/angelhof/edsger_compiler">source</a>),
  an implementation of the Chord protocol
  (<a href="https://github.com/angelhof/chord-distributed-erlang">source</a>),
  and an extension of the SIP Communicator
  (<a href="https://github.com/angelhof/sip-project-extensions">source</a>).

  I have also participated in Google Summer of Code 2017, where I
  worked with <a href="https://github.com/zinid">Evgeny Khramtsov</a>
  to
  extend <a href="https://github.com/processone/ejabberd">ejabberd</a>. I
  implemented a mechanism that allows for certificate acquiring
  through the <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme">ACME</a>
  protocol.
