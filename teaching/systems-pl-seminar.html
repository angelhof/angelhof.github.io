<h3 class="page-heading">Synopsis</h3>

<p class="homepage">
This graduate-level course covers advanced topics related to the design and implementation of software systems that either target real programming languages and environments, or use insights from the field of programming languages and compilers. Topics that we will cover include optimization systems for scripting languages like Python and Notebooks, as well as reasoning about the performance and correctness of real-world software systems.
<!-- A tentative list of topics that will be covered includes serverless, microservices, cloud data processing, and performance analysis. -->
</p>

<p class="homepage">
This course is targeted for students who either (1) do research, (2) know that they want to do research but haven't started, or (3) want to explore the potential of doing research (e.g., by applying to a PhD program).
Therefore its structure is different from other classes.
</p>

<p class="homepage">
It has three main axes: paper reading, paper writing, and conducting research.
Discussion-oriented classes focus on in-depth analysis of readings. Students will do a collaborative final research project on topic of their choice. The project is intended to align with the student interests, with the potential to contribute toward a publication in a top-tier venue. Guided by the final project and inspired by the papers we read, throughout the course students will also learn how to write a research paper.
</p>

<p class="homepage">
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify open research problems in the intersection of systems and programming languages.
    </li>
    <li>
        Read papers critically and write constructive reviews.
    </li>
    <li>
        Plan, structure, and write a research paper.
    </li>
    <li>
        Design and execute a research project to address an open research problem.
    </li>
</ul>
  
</p>

<p class="homepage">
Since the size of the class is limited, not all students might be able to enroll. 
However if you are interested in the course, sign up for the waitlist and come to the first lecture. 
I will try to enroll as many waitlisted students as possible if there is significant interest.
</p>

<h3 class="page-heading">Prerequisites</h3>

<p class="homepage">
No strict prerequisites, but having taken courses on systems topics would be useful. Some example relevant courses are: 
Distributed Systems (CS 134), 
Compilers (CS 132), 
Programming Languages (CS 131), 
Operating Systems (CS 111), 
Web Applications (CS 144),
Parallel and Distributed Computing (CS 133), 
Data Management Systems (CS 143), 
and Networks (CS 118). 
<!-- These are advanced courses so letting them out for now -->
<!-- Big Data Systems (CS 214), -->
<!-- Parallel Programming (CS 233A), -->
<!-- Advanced Operating Systems (CS 235), -->
</p>

<h3 class="page-heading">Grading</h3>

<p class="homepage">
Response papers (20%); Participation/Discussion (30%); Project (Paper + Presentation) (50%).
</p>

<h3 class="page-heading">Response papers</h3>

<p class="homepage">
Students will prepare an insightful critique of the 
assigned papers due at the beginning of class. 
These response papers should address the following three axes: 
    problem statement,
    key insight,
    evaluation.
Read 
<a href="https://angelhof.github.io/2024/08/21/how_to_read_a_systems_paper.html">this post</a> 
for more context on important axes of systems papers. 
The response papers can be as short as 0.5 pages and no longer than 1 page.
</p>

<h3 class="page-heading">Participation/Discussion</h3>

<p class="homepage">
This course focuses heavily on class participation and discussion. 
Students are expected to read the assigned papers and 
prepare for discussions. 
</p>

<!-- <p class="homepage">
The class will be organized into three groups. 
The first group leads the discussion, the second group discusses the paper from the perspective of the author, the third group discusses the paper from the perspective of a critic. Group assignments will rotate throughout the semester. Attendance is expected and will count towards participation. Please contact the instructor if special circumstances will cause you to miss class.
</p> -->

<h3 class="page-heading">Project</h3>

<p class="homepage">
Teams of up to four students will define and execute a research project in the area of systems and programming languages, broadly defined.
The goal is for the project to align with the students' existing research and be a steping stone for a publication at a top-tier venue. Students will write a research paper and make a final presentation.
</p>

<h3 class="page-heading">Reading list</h3>

<p class="homepage">
We will be reading papers from conferences like: 
SOSP, PLDI, OSDI, ASPLOS, NSDI, EuroSys, POPL, ATC, OOPSLA, ICFP, and SoCC.
</p>

<p class="homepage">
We will be reading papers in the following categories: 
black-box application optimization,
Python optimization,
Python usability,
and automated application correctness.
</p>

<p class="homepage">
Here is a tentative paper list:
