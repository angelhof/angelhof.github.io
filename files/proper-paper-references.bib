    abstract = {Scripting languages are widely used to compose external calls such as native libraries and network services. In such scripts, execution time is often dominated by waiting for these external calls, rendering traditional single-language optimizations ineffective. To address this, we propose a novel opportunistic evaluation strategy for scripting languages based on a core lambda calculus that automatically dispatches independent external calls in parallel and streams their results. We prove that our approach is confluent, ensuring that it preserves the programmer’s original intent, and that it eventually executes every external call. We implement this approach in a scripting language called Opal. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of Opal, focusing on programs that invoke heavy external computation through the use of large language models (LLMs) and other APIs. Across five scripts, we compare to several state-of-the-art baselines and show that opportunistic evaluation improves total running time (up to 6.2\texttimes{}) and latency (up to 12.7\texttimes{}) compared to standard sequential Python, while performing very close (between 1.3\% and 18.5\% running time overhead) to hand-tuned manually optimized asynchronous Rust. For Tree-of-Thoughts, a prominent LLM reasoning approach, we achieve a 6.2\texttimes{} performance improvement over the authors’ own implementation.},

It is also quite complex, due to the structure of shell programs, their use of opaque software components, and their complex interactions with the broader environment. As a result, even when exercising an abundance of care, shell developers discover devastating bugs in their programs only at runtime: at best, shell programs going wrong crash the execution of a long-running task; at worst, they silently corrupt the broader environment in which they execute---affecting user data, modifying system files, and rendering entire systems unusable.

    abstract = {Real-time data processing applications with low latency requirements have led to the increasing popularity of stream processing systems. While such systems offer convenient APIs that can be used to achieve data parallelism automatically, they offer limited support for computations that require synchronization between parallel nodes. In this paper, we propose dependency-guided synchronization (DGS), an alternative programming model for stateful streaming computations with complex synchronization requirements. In the proposed model, the input is viewed as partially ordered, and the program consists of a set of parallelization constructs which are applied to decompose the partial order and process events independently. Our programming model maps to an execution model called synchronization plans which supports synchronization between parallel nodes. Our evaluation shows that APIs offered by two widely used systems---Flink and Timely Dataflow---cannot suitably expose parallelism in some representative applications. In contrast, DGS enables implementations with scalable performance, the resulting synchronization plans offer throughput improvements when implemented manually in existing systems, and the programming overhead is small compared to writing sequential code.},

Our framework unifies sequential (ordered) and relational (unordered) data models. In particular, we define synchronization schemas as types, and series-parallel streams (SPS) as objects of these types. A synchronization schema imposes a hierarchical structure over relational types that succinctly captures ordering and synchronization requirements among different kinds of data items. Series-parallel streams naturally model objects such as relations, sequences, sequences of relations, sets of streams indexed by key values, time-based and event-based windows, and more complex structures obtained by nesting of these. We introduce series-parallel stream transformers (SPST) as a domain-specific language for modular specification of deterministic transformations over such streams. SPSTs provably specify only monotonic transformations allowing streamability, have a modular structure that can be exploited for correct parallel implementation, and are composable allowing specification of complex queries as a pipeline of transformations.},

A lightweight annotation language allows command developers to express key parallelizability properties about their commands. An accompanying parallelizability study of POSIX and GNU commands---two large and commonly used groups---guides the annotation language and optimized aggregator library that PaSh uses. PaSh's extensive evaluation over 44 unmodified Unix scripts shows significant speedups (0.89--61.1\texttimes{}, avg: 6.7\texttimes{}) stemming from the combination of its program transformations and runtime primitives.},

We present Mir, a system addressing dynamic compromise by introducing a fine-grained read-write-execute (RWX) permission model at the boundaries of libraries: every field of every free variable name in the context of an imported library is governed by a permission set. To help specify the permissions given to existing code, Mir's automated inference generates default permissions by analyzing how libraries are used by their clients. Applied to over 1,000 JavaScript libraries for Node.js, Mir shows practical security (61/63 attacks mitigated), performance (2.1s for static analysis and +1.93\% for dynamic enforcement), and compatibility (99.09\%) characteristics---and enables a novel quantification of privilege reduction.},

Exploiting the parallelism afforded by such platforms, while preserving the semantics of the desired computation, is prone to errors, and motivates the development of tools for specification, testing, and verification. We focus on the problem of differential output testing for distributed stream processing systems, that is, checking whether two implementations produce equivalent output streams in response to a given input stream. The notion of equivalence allows reordering of logically independent data items, and the main technical contribution of the paper is an optimal online algorithm for checking this equivalence. Our testing framework is implemented as a library called DiffStream in Flink. We present four case studies to illustrate how our framework can be used to (1) correctly identify bugs in a set of benchmark MapReduce programs, (2) facilitate the development of difficult-to-parallelize high performance applications, and (3) monitor an application for a long period of time with minimal performance overhead.},

HiPErJiT uses runtime profiling to decide which modules to compile to native code and which of their functions to inline and type-specialize. HiPErJiT is integrated with the runtime system of Erlang/OTP and preserves aspects of Erlang's compilation which are crucial for its applications: most notably, tail-call optimization and hot code loading at the module level. We present HiPErJiT's architecture, describe the optimizations that it performs, and compare its performance with BEAM, HiPE, and Pyrlang. HiPErJiT offers performance which is about two times faster than BEAM and almost as fast as HiPE, despite the profiling and compilation overhead that it has to pay compared to an ahead-of-time native code compiler. But there also exist programs for which HiPErJiT's profile-driven optimizations allow it to surpass HiPE's performance.},
