<p class="homepage">
  I am an assistant professor of computer science at 
  <a href="https://www.cs.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>.  
  My research interests lie in the intersection of computer systems, compilers, and programming languages.

  <!-- This should be part of a bio and not my overview -->
   <!-- fortunate to be advised
  by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/">Rajeev Alur</a>.  -->
  <!-- I have interned in Microsoft Research, where I worked with
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sburckha/">Sebastian Burckhardt</a>,
  and in the Automated Reasoning Group in AWS, where I worked with 
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-schwartz-narbonne-5036b9137/">Daniel Schwartz-Narbonne</a>.
  Before my PhD, I studied at the National Technical University of Athens,
  where I was advised by <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/">Kostis Sagonas</a>. -->

  <a href="https://manosth.github.io/mentoring_initiative/">CS PhD MentoRes</a> in 2021, 
  a mentoring initiative for people that are interested in applying for PhD programs 
  in Computer Science and related fields but don't have access to adequate resources.

  <b>Looking for students:</b>
  I am looking for motivated students to work with me on 
  problems in computer systems, compilers, and programming languages.

  If you are interested in the style of research that I am doing, read

  <b>Note:</b>
  I am committed to ensuring that everyone feels comfortable being part of our research community.
  I am always happy to talk to anyone (junior or senior) who feels like they want to share or discuss anything; be it a negative (or positive) experience, an interaction with another member of our community, or an issue with university and other processes.
  I have often needed to seek help myself and found that having access to a listening ear is very helpful.

  <!-- We live in an era of unprecedented compute availability. 
  The advent of the cloud allows anyone to deploy critical high-performance applications 
  that serve millions of users without owning or managing any computational resources.  -->
  
  The goal of my research is <b>to enable the development of high-performance applications 
    with robust correctness guarantees</b>. 
    
  To achieve this goal, I build practical programmable software systems that target realistic workloads in widely-used environments. 
  
  I build my systems on solid foundations using 
  <!-- formal specifications and  -->
  techniques drawn from the programming languages, compilers, and formal methods literature.

<p class="homepage">
  I am interested in doing research that leads to 
  usable open-source systems.
  As an example, my research has led to the development of the
  <a href="https://github.com/binpash">PaSh project</a>,
  a software ecosystem that
  is supported by the 
  <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/linux-foundation-to-host-the-pash-project-accelerating-shell-scripting-with-automated-parallelization-for-industrial-use-cases/">Linux Foundation</a>
  and has a lively open-source community.
